# IDHL Tech Test

We’d like to invite you to take part in a front-end development test.

## Your task: Build a responsive landing page, with add to bag functionality.

The test is for a fictional pet brand who require a responsive landing page with add to bag functionality. When the “add to bag” button is clicked, a cart slides out from the right.

Please note: The cart content can be pre-populated, meaning no requirement to remove products, calculate total prices, or increment the cart counter.

Our designers have created a desktop and mobile design for the page, which [can be found here](https://www.figma.com/design/KHyWaNSNVgxghHrzHWNn3n/Shopify-Dev-Task?node-id=0-1&m=dev&t=VLW6HnrKm7GtuHcN-1).

## Requirements

- Mobile first build
- A naming convention such as BEM, for easy to follow css classes and structure
- Implement the slide out cart functionality using JavaScript
- Use animations for opening/closing the cart
- Ensure the slide out cart is scrollable on mobiles and tablets
- Ensure the implementation is cross-browser friendly
- Build reusable components that could be used on other areas of the website
- Use Roboto and Open Sans fonts – which are available via Google Fonts

### Optional tasks

- Demonstrate the use of a task runner such as Gulp, Grunt, or Webpack.
- Demonstrate the use of precompiled styles e.g. SCSS or LESS.
- Create a 1 second loading animation before the slide out cart opens

### Please don't:

- Use any frameworks for styling or functionality (e.g. Bootstrap, React)
- Use any third party plugins providing modal functionality (e.g. Lightbox)
