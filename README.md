# IDHL Tech Test

We’d like to invite you to take part in a front-end development test.

## Your task: Build a responsive landing page, with add to bag functionality.

The test is for a fictional pet brand who require a responsive landing page with add to bag functionality. When the “add to bag” button is clicked, a cart slides out from the right.

Please note: The cart content can be pre-populated, meaning no requirement to remove products, calculate total prices, or increment the cart counter.

Our designers have created a desktop and mobile design for the page, which can be found in the assets folder.

## Requirements

 - Mobile first build
 - A naming convention such as BEM, for easy to follow css classes and structure
 - Implement the slide out cart functionality using JavaScript
 - Use animations for opening/closing the cart
 - Ensure the slide out cart is scrollable on mobiles and tablets
 - Ensure the implementation is cross-browser friendly
 - Build reusable components that could be used on other areas of the website
 - Use Roboto and Open Sans fonts – which are available via Google Fonts


### Optional tasks

 - Demonstrate the use of a task runner such as Gulp, Grunt, or Webpack.
 - Demonstrate the use of precompiled styles e.g. SASS or LESS.
 - Create a 1 second loading animation before the slide out cart opens

### Please don't:

 - Use any frameworks for styling or functionality (e.g. Bootstrap, React)
 - Use any third party plugins providing modal functionality (e.g. Lightbox)
